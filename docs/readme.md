## General

### Naming

Global context variables are $process and $kernel.

$process is used to access the current running process and general process information.
$kernel is used to access the kernel and its information. Such as scheduler, memory manager, etc.

"$" prefix is used for global (extern) variables.
Normally external variables are avoided.
